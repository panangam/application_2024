The option of completing a supervised thesis at UCSD, particularly under Professor Albert Chern of the Visual Computing Center, strongly motivates my application to this program. His focus on geometry processing and geometric modeling aligns perfectly with my academic interests. While independently studying Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG), I came across his publication [**"Computing Minimal Surfaces with Differential Forms"**](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~alchern/projects/MinimalCurrent/)â€”a paper that showed me an exciting, elegant application of DDG and inspired my pursuit of research in this direction. The paper exemplifies the research approach I aspire to pursue in my thesis: translating theoretical insights from smooth geometry into robust discrete algorithms. Under Professor Chern's mentorship, I aim to gain not only technical expertise, but also the ability to conduct and communicate truly impactful research.
