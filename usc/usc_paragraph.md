Professor Oded Stein and his Geometry and Graphics Group strongly influenced my decision to apply to USC. His focus in geometry processing aligns perfectly with my interests and goals; his published work and research statements feel like glimpses into my own future academic aspirations. His presentation on Python-based geometry processing at SGP 2024 resonated with my experience at unspun, where I extensively used Python for geometric computations. Further, his publication [“Developability of Triangle Meshes”](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/DiscreteDevelopable/) exemplifies the research approach I aspire to pursue: translating theoretical insights from smooth geometry into robust discrete algorithms. Building upon this work, I envision a master's thesis that would extend the algorithm to incorporate user-specified curvature concentration constraints. Under Professor Stein's mentorship, I aim to gain not only technical expertise, but also the ability to conduct and communicate truly impactful research.
