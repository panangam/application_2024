Professor **Oded Stein** and the **Geometry and Graphics Group** strongly influence my decision to apply to USC. His focus in geometry processing aligns perfectly with my interests and goals; reading his published works and research interests feels like getting a glimpse into my own future academic aspirations. His presentation on **Python-based geometry processing** at SGP 2024 highly resonated with my experience at unspun, where I extensively used Python for geometric computations. Further, his publication [**“Developability of Triangle Meshes”**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/DiscreteDevelopable/) exemplifies the research approach I aspire to pursue: translating theoretical insights from smooth geometry into robust discrete algorithms. Building upon this work, I envision a master's thesis that would introduce more control over the final shape by incorporating user-specified curvature concentration constraints. Under Professor Stein's mentorship, I aim to gain not only technical expertise, but also the ability to conduct and communicate truly impactful research.
