Professor **Silvia Sellán** strongly influences my decision to apply to Columbia. Her focus in geometry processing aligns perfectly with my interests and goals. Her recent publications on Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), ["Reach for the Spheres"](https://odedstein.com/projects/reach-for-the-spheres/) and ["Reach for the Arcs,"](https://odedstein.com/projects/reach-for-the-arcs/) have particularly resonated with my research interests. The "Spheres" paper's elegant geometric solution to surface reconstruction, which outperforms data-driven approaches through its consideration of global SDF sample properties, demonstrates that fundamental geometric insights can still advance the field—which tells me this field still has much untapped potential. While studying the "Arcs" paper, I developed several theoretical questions about alternative approaches to the surface point sampling and stitching method. For instance, given that sphere intersections form circular chords analogous to sphere-plane intersections, a modified half-edge data structure utilizing spherical arcs might offer a more direct solution. Although I acknowledge that my current understanding of these complex topics may be incomplete, I am eager to explore the possibility of basing my thesis upon this idea. Under Professor Sellán's mentorship, I aim to gain not only technical expertise, but also the ability to conduct and communicate truly impactful research.
