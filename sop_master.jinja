Hundreds of individuals worldwide are currently sporting denim jeans crafted from a technology I created. 

At **unspun**, my first job out of undergrad, I designed a novel system for **converting a 3D body scan into a sewable denim jeans pattern**. This was a difficult task: there is no obvious way to flatten our curved body into flat pieces, and traditional tailoring would require multiple fittings. Through independent study of theliterature and experimentation, I explored several solution spaces, including 3D-to-2D shape flattening and CAD-style constrained shape designing. In the end, a combination of **machine learning** and **geometric processing** was the answer. Using **geodesic calculation**, I extracted body measurements from the scan. Using **statistical human shape spaces**—pre-trained neural networks describing human body variability using a few principle components—I was able to correlate body shape with pattern shape. Finally, utilizing SciPy's **constrained optimization** toolbox with my own **Python-based geometry kernels**, I devised an **energy minization** scheme to optimize the patterns for sewability, including seam alignment and angle compatibility. As a named inventor on this technology's [**patent**](https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/PCT%2FUS23%2F11979), I brought about a paradigm shift for unspun, increasing our fit-rate by 15%—with 90% of customers satisfied with the fit of their pants at their first try-on—and cutting human intervention required by 50%. 

This experience cemented my research interest in **geometry processing**, a field where my love for computer science and mathematical geometry coexist. More specifically, it introduced me to **discrete differential geometry (DDG)**—the study of smooth surfaces approximated by discrete elements, enabling computation—and gave me hands-on experience with **3D geometric machine learning**. These emerging fields, with their many unsolved problems, are where I wish to focus my graduate studies.

My research journey began at Santa Clara University. Though I initially published my work on latent Dirichlet allocation-based topic modeling at **IEEE IRC 2018**, it was the mentorship of Dr. Thomas Banchoff during his year-long visit from Brown University that revealed my true passion for geometry. Under his guidance and specialty in higher-dimensional geometry, I tackled the challenge of making abstract mathematical concepts tangible through computation. By visualizing the projections of the 4-dimensional Cartan 3-manifold's polyhedral form and, in collaboration with the Virtual Reality Lab, creating an interactive **4-dimensional geometric VR experience**, I developed crucial skills in translating complex geometric concepts into intuitive visual representations. This foundation in geometric visualization and computational geometric thinking directly influenced my work at unspun and throughout my career.

My subsequent industry experiences further deepened my engagement with geometry across diverse applications, starting with my aforementioned work at unspun. At **Yannix**, a Bangkok-based visual effects company serving major Hollywood studios, I led the research initiative on **Monte Carlo**-based simulation of anamorphic lens aberration effects and developed **Bayesian inference**-based robust feature extraction, leading to new product offerings. At Tesla's Autopilot division, I engineered Pytorch-based **GPU-accelerated** solutions for transforming **3D pointcloud** scenes into **neural network**-compatible representations, directly supporting our autonomous driving research. All of these experiences taught me the value of starting with analytical geometric models rather than immediately turning to AI solutions. Geometric principles provide foundational frameworks for AI system design, while AI's capacity to learn from data bridge the gap between models and real-world complexity. 

Through these experiences, I also developed competencies essential for graduate-level research: ideation and reiterations, managing stakeholder relationships, crafting compelling proposals, producing maintainable, well-documented code, and timeline adherence. As a key example, across all three positions, I consistently balanced research exploration with practical implementation to deliver viable solutions within established timelines, which are crucial for downstream stakeholders. I have no doubt an analogous challenge will present itself in my graduate study—having to balance between exploring for curiosity's sake and producing papers/thesis. And I will be well-prepared to face it. 

{% if is_master %}
What draws me to research is my ability to make a significant impact on unsolved problems and how I can fully unleash my creativity in the process. However, after four years of industry research, my bachelor's degree no longer suffices for the depth of research I aspire to pursue. This is why I currently aspire to pursue a PhD. While I have successfully led R&D projects across three companies, I recognize that the {{ master_program_name }} program at {{ school }} would provide two crucial elements I need before pursuing a PhD: **immersion in academic research**, and **advanced mathematical foundations**. This master's program would serve as a vital bridge between my industry experience and my ultimate goal of pursuing a PhD, and I'm eager to learn the methodologies of academic research from established scholars in the field.

What draws me to research is my ability to make a significant impact on unsolved problems and how I can fully unleash my creativity in the process. However, after four years of industry research, I now aim to pursue deeper, more fundamental research questions that require the rigorous training and mentorship of a PhD program. While I have successfully led R&D projects across three companies, I often found the business goals to prevent me from fully exploring my research questions. {{ school }}'s PhD program would provide the perfect environment to pursue my research interests in geometry processing with no impediment, and it will enable me to pursue a career in research afterwards, whether in academia or industry. The prospect of working with professors who are actively pushing the boundaries of geometric computing particularly excites me, and I'm eager to learn the methodologies of academic research from established scholars in the field.

{{ school_paragraph }}

As a nosey problem solver, I enjoy confronting problems by imagining new ways to dissect them and creating novel solutions. I have been able to build great solutions with my limited formal training—from crafting jeans that people wear to simulating anamorphic lenses used in cinematic visual effects. Further training from {{ school }}'s {% if is_master %} master's program, and subsequently the PhD, {% else %} PhD program {% endif %} will enable me to go back into the world and ask more complex questions about more sophisticated problems, wrestling with the kind of scientific questions that inspire me to find answers no one else has ever thought of before.

{% if include_personal_paragraph %}
Beyond advancing my professional and research capabilities, my six years in the United States profoundly shaped my personal growth. The Bay Area provided me with resources to embrace my identity as a gay man and begin understanding my neurodivergent traits—opportunities that were limited in Thailand's more traditional environment. While serving as an active member of LGBTQ+ organizations and finding a supportive queer community, I thrived despite undiagnosed challenges that I would later understand as autism spectrum disorder and ADHD. However, upon returning to Thailand, I found myself constrained by a hierarchical research culture that often prioritizes conformity over innovation. Though I never stopped advancing new ideas, this experience has strengthened my resolve to return to the US, where both my personal identity and professional creativity can flourish.
