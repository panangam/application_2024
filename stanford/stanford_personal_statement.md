Beyond advancing my professional and research capabilities, my six years in the United States profoundly shaped my personal growth. The Bay Area provided me with resources to embrace my identity as a gay man and begin understanding my neurodivergent traits—opportunities that were limited in Thailand's more traditional environment. In the Bay Area, I served as an active member of two volunteer-run gay organizations—The 15 Association and Delta Brotherhood—providing gay, bi, transgender, pansexual, and queer men exploring healthy expressions of alternative sexuality and ethical non-monogamy. As part of Delta’s team since 2019, I’ve helped produce our annual weeklong retreat for 300+ men converging internationally for fellowship, education, and networking. With my community, I thrived despite undiagnosed challenges that I would later understand as autism spectrum disorder and ADHD.

I have since brought this influence back with me to Thailand, where I am an active member of Bangkok's queer community. Though lacking any formal community organizations, I have been teaching classes using skills on healthy sexuality I learned from my time in the West, covering safety, partner communication, and technical skills. However, Thailand's resistance to new ideas about sexuality necessitates a discreet approach to these initiatives. This same resistance to change also manifests in my research work, where I found myself constantly constrained by a hierarchical culture that often prioritizes conformity over innovation. Though I never stopped advancing new ideas despite resistance from leadership, these parallel experiences have strengthened my resolve to return to the US, where both my personal identity and professional creativity can truly flourish.

Stanford's location holds deep personal significance for me—it would mean coming home to a community that helped shape who I am. This sense of belonging is reinforced by Stanford's comprehensive support systems—including dedicated mental health resources and active LGBTQ+ student organizations—which demonstrate its commitment to student well-being. Having experienced firsthand how the right environment enables success, I'm particularly drawn to Stanford's understanding that academic excellence flourishes when students are fully supported. This combination of community, support, and academic rigor creates an ideal environment where I can focus entirely on pushing the boundaries of research while being authentically myself.
