Stanford's Master of Science with Distinction in Research program particularly resonates with my aspirations to delve deeper into academic research, making Stanford my ideal choice for graduate studies. I am especially inspired by Professor **Doug James**' work in computer graphics and simulation. His paper [**"Progressive Simulation for Cloth Quasistatics"**](https://pcs-sim.github.io/) has direct connections to my professional experience at unspun, where I applied fabric simulation systems for fit prediction. Having worked with adaptive dynamic remeshing techniques in an industry setting, I am eager to explore how these methods could enhance progressive simulation approaches under Professor James's guidance. I envision this research direction, combining efficient simulation techniques with practical applications in garment modeling, as a compelling focus for my thesis work at Stanford.
