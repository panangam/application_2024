Professor **Keenan Crane** and the **Geometry Collective** strongly influence my decision to apply to CMU. At unspun, I utilized his [**intrinsic triangulation-based geodesic calculation**](https://nmwsharp.com/research/flip-geodesics/) in the 3D body scan processing pipeline. I also drew upon his [**"Boundary-First Flattening"**](https://geometrycollective.github.io/boundary-first-flattening/) algorithm to assess the effectiveness of 3D-to-2D pattern flattening approach. Beyond technical contributions, I am deeply inspired by Dr. Crane’s ability to cohesively integrate mathematical reasoning, algorithmic design, and practical implementation in his well-illustrated papers. His clear and engaging figures make complex concepts more accessible than words or equations alone, a skill I aspire to develop in my own academic publications. I had the privilege of experiencing his friendly demeanor and effective teaching style at the 2021 FRG Workshop on Geometric Methods, which motivated me to independently complete his discrete differential geometry course using his online resources. To deepen my understanding through peer discussion and teaching, I created a [**Discord study group**](https://discord.gg/WCMxBg5w), mentoring others also taking the course. My current initial thesis idea builds on Dr. Crane’s work in his paper [**“Developability of Triangle Meshes”**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/DiscreteDevelopable/), aiming to introduce more control over the final surface shape by incorporating user-specified curvature concentration constraints. Under the mentorship of Professor Crane and the Geometry Collective, I hope to gain not only technical expertise, but also the ability to conduct and communicate impactful research.
