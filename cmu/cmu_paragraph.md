Professor Keenan Crane and the Geometry Collective strongly influenced my decision to apply to CMU. While developing my pant production technology at unspun, I utilized his [intrinsic triangulation-based geodesic calculation](https://nmwsharp.com/research/flip-geodesics/) in the 3D body scan processing pipeline. I also drew upon his ["Boundary-First Flattening"](https://geometrycollective.github.io/boundary-first-flattening/) algorithm to assess the effectiveness of directly flattening the body mesh into sewable patterns. Beyond these practical applications, I am inspired by Dr. Crane's writing, with how he cohesively combines mathematical reasoning, algorithmic thinking, and practical code. His well-illustrated papers are able to articulate complex concepts and results more effectively than words and equations can, and I aspire to achieve this in my own publications. After experiencing his friendly demeanor and teaching style at the FRG Workshop on Geometric Methods in 2021, I was inspired to independently complete his discrete differential geometry course using his online resources. To deepen my understanding through peer discussion and teaching, I created a [Discord study group](https://discord.gg/WCMxBg5w) where I mentor others who are independently taking the course. My current initial idea for a master’s thesis is an extension of his work in [“Developability of Triangle Meshes”](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/DiscreteDevelopable/), introducing more control over the final placement of creases by drawing insights from developable rollers. Under the mentorship of Professor Crane and the Geometry Collective, I hope to gain not only technical expertise, but also the ability to conduct and communicate truly impactful research.
